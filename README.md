# ML-for-Electrical-Resistivity-of-Alloys
This project provides a pre-trained artificial neural network model for predicting the electrical resistivity of thin-film alloys, trained on a combinatorial alloy database.

It also includes scripts for extrapolating the resistivity of alloys fabricated via the sputter deposition process, as well as for training customized models in cases where users have limited sample information.

Further details are available in the article titled “Unveiling Key Descriptors for Electrical Resistivity of Alloys Using High-Throughput Experiments and Explainable AI”, authored by Taeyeop Kim and Dongwoo Lee.
